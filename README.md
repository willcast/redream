Start by cloning the repository and setting up a build directory.

git clone https://github.com/inolen/redream.git
mkdir redream_build
cd redream_build
```

Next, generate a makefile or project file for your IDE of choice. For more info on the supported IDEs, checkout the [CMake documentation](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html).

```
# Makefile
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE ../redream
